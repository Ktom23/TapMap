TapMap
======

“Tap Map” is a map-based application that locates alcohol-serving establishments in the greater Newark, DE area. When the user clicks upon an establishment, the application opens up a menu of the beers which are offered either on tap or bottle.  Once the user decides on a location, he/she may enter and order a selection of beer. While enjoying the beverage, the user may also return back into the “Tap Map” app and rate the beverage. These ratings are converted into a cumulative average, are assigned to a beer, and show up next to the beer on each individual restaurants’ list.  Newark, DE will be used as a pilot location to see how successful this application can prove to be.
